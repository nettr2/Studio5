## Week 1 Lesson 1 & 2
<br/>
I have choosen to join the mobile team this semester. For our project, what i know so far is that it will be a kind of mentoring oppurtunity with a group of students from St Hildas. I beleve they are developing a mobile app and our goal is to guide them through the process. Out of the mobile team, there are four of us working on this particular project. I am planning to research vue.js as I believe they will be using this in their project. I have been linked to a video tutorial for creating a basic vue.js app, and so i will follow this through before we meet with the students, which will be this thursday. (30/07)

## Week 2 Lesson 1 & 2

<br/>
I completed the vue app that grayson showed us. Its a weather app that uses an api to get the live weather updates. It took a while to complete, as i've never written anything in vue  before. The code layout was interesting, with everything being in one file. The tutorial was very stylistically focused, and had lots of little css details to really grab the attention of the user. I was really pleased with the outcome, It ended up looking pretty cool. This thursday was the day that we were supposed to meet the "clients", but I had to leave early as I ate something bad that didn't agree with me and I felt pretty sick. I asked Kirsten to fill me in the with details afterwards. We had our first stand up meeting at the start of this week, which was nice just to see where everyone was at. We also made a github repo and set up a kanban board, ready for when we have things that need to be done.

## Week 3 
Over the weekend I looked up some useful github/gitbash resources to send to our clients, as they want to start using git for their project. Kirsten filled me in on the what happened on thrusda. The girls are using firebase in the application for authentication, and then airtable for the database. I researched both of these over the weekend as well. Then during the lesson, I gave kirsten my resources and along with some that resources she found as well, an email was sent off so they can get started using git. I'm going to try out some tutorials on how to set up firebase authentication, and see if I can get something working so i can help them when they come to do that part of their project. We also had a standup meeting with all of team which was good to catch up and see whats going on. Kirsten is going to add the girls to the project repo when they make github accounts, and we have asked them to push their design plan so we can see what they have already got. 

The girls got in contact with us, mentioning that they were having trouble with setting up github on their computers. We have arranged to have a video chat with them today (6/08)so we can walk them through the process of downloading git bash (they have mac computers and seemed to be struggling with finding the download for macs) and then how to clone the project repo, and push and pull their work. I have included some screenshots of our emails. I also wrote up a rough step by step for how to setup the basics in git, mostly just for me and kirstin to work from while teaching them.

We had our first video meeting this afternoon, it was definitly an interesting experiance. Neither me nor kirsten have much experience using mac, the process for installing gitbash is a bit different. I didn't know this, but apparently macs come with gitbash already installed, i realised this after i asked them to run git --version. We had planned to walk them through the whole proccess of clonging and pushing and pulling their first bits of work, but unfortunatly we ran out of time and only managed to get to the cloning part. It was a learning experience for sure though. I posted the step by steps that i came up with earlier in the wiki on github & then kirsten expanded on it and added some details. Hopefully this will help them try and give it a go at home. If they get stuck they will be able email us and we can help them out.

## Week 4 
This week I got an email fowarded from grayson about the payment system that the girls are using for their app. It's called polipay. I went to their website and read through some of the documentation, just to try and get an understanding of how it works. Then on monday we had a standup meeting with all of our team, and grayson let us know that in the next class we would be having our quarter review. I spent a bit of time trying to get the firebase authentication working on my vue weather app, but i'm really struggling to get it to work in vue, so i might try and implement just in a basic html page. I have interacted with the girls this week by arranging a face to face meeting time. We are planning to meet on monday(17/08) at 1:30, alhough this may change due to covid. They were also having some trouble with git, in particular merging. They sent us a screenshot of the error they were getting when they tried to push their code, so we sent them some info about how to fix it on the slack channel. I am working on updating our team wiki with some more git commands related to merging and checking the status of their workflow.
