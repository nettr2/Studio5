I have choosen to join the mobile team this semester. For our project, what i know so far is that it will be a kind of mentoring oppurtunity with a group of students from St Hildas. I beleve they are developing a mobile app and our goal is to guide them through the process. Out of the mobile team, there are four of us working on this particular project. I am planning to research vue.js as I believe they will be using this in their project. I have been linked to a video tutorial for creating a basic jue.js app, and so i will follow this through before we meet with the students, which will be this thursday. (30/07)
