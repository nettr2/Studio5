Week 1 Lesson 1 & 2 
I have choosen to join the mobile team this semester. For our project, what i know so far is that it will be a kind of mentoring oppurtunity with a group of students from St Hildas. I beleve they are developing a mobile app and our goal is to guide them through the process. Out of the mobile team, there are four of us working on this particular project. I am planning to research vue.js as I believe they will be using this in their project. I have been linked to a video tutorial for creating a basic vue.js app, and so i will follow this through before we meet with the students, which will be this thursday. (30/07)

Week 2 Lesson 1 & 2
I completed the vue app that grayson showed us. Its a weather app that uses an api to get the live weather updates. It took a while to complete, as i've never written anything in vue  before. The code layout was interesting, with everything being in one file. The tutorial was very stylistically focused, and had lots of little css details to really grab the attention of the user. I was really pleased with the outcome, It ended up looking pretty cool. This thursday was the day that we were supposed to meet the "clients", but I had to leave early as I ate something bad that didn't agree with me and I felt pretty sick. I asked Kirsten to fill me in the with details afterwards.
